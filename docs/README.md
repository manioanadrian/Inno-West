## Requirements

In order to utilize the product [.net5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0) framework or higher needs to be installed on the same machine with the docker.

## Configuration

All configrations are done in the settings page of the broker.

1. PLC Ip: is the IP of the programable controller which drives the robot cell and gathers the data.
2. Server Ip: is the IP of the docker image with the Crate data base.
3. User: Username to access the db.
4. Pw: Password to access the db.
5. Production Table: Is the table from the CrateDB where the production data will be stored.
6. Part Table: Is the table from the CrateDB where the parts data will be stored.

> Optional it can be added to run automaticaly at startup. 

## Usage

First step is to have the docker database configured as descried [here](/docker/README.md)
Second of all is to program the PLC (programable logic controller) to exchange data with the broker. 
To achive this some steps need to be reached:

1. First and formemost the broker is built in mind with only the siemens PLCs and there needs to be a DB (datablock) number 26.

> The code for it be found here as ['DB_DIH2_EX.db'](/api/DB_DIH2_EX.db). 

2. The following structure needs to be built in.

> The code for it be found here as ['UDT_DB_DIH2_EX.db'](/api/UDT_DB_DIH2_EX.udt).

3. To able to communicate with the PLC a protocol was put in place. The TRIG signal that is of type INT will be our exchange interface with predefined commands as follow: <br>
* 0   - Waiting Trigger; <br>
* 1   - Trigger to Write Production data; <br>
* 2   - Trigger to Write Part data; <br>
* 100 - Write Production Error; <br>
* 101 - Write Part Error;<br>
* 255 - Bussy;<br>

4. After creating the logic and the DB in the PLC we can start our api. If the connection is not succesfull an error will be thrown in the logfile.

## Testing

Testing the data exchange between PLC-API-FIWARE can be done in the created interface of the apic or via the logfile if there are errors or something doens't seem to be working. <br>
This data exchange is done in realtime (~500ms) and the data is refreshed at every cycle.
