## Requirements

In order to utilize the product [.net5](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/5.0) framework or higher needs to be installed on the same machine with the docker.
Also it requires a preinstalled functional welding robot cell with a Siemens PLC.

## Configuration

All api configrations are done in the settings page of the broker.

<img width="200" alt="settings" src="img/settings.png">

1. PLC Ip: is the IP of the programable controller which drives the robot cell and gathers the data.
2. Server Ip: is the IP of the docker image with the Crate data base.
3. Port number used to connect with the server.
4. PLC Datablock: Datablock number from the logic controller.
5. Workstation ID: Workstation identification for the workstation going to be used .
6. Unit ID: Unit identification for the unit going to be used.

> Optional it can be added to run automaticaly at startup via the startup windows tool or the task scheduler by creating a new task with the api.
> 1. Startup folder can be accessed via Run and type in *shell:startup*.
> 2. Add the shortcut of the api here.

## Usage

First step is to have the docker database configured as descried [here](/docker/README.md)
Second of all is to program the PLC (programable logic controller) to exchange data with the broker. 
To achive this some steps need to be reached:

1. First and formemost the broker is built in mind with only the siemens PLCs and there needs to be a DB (datablock) imported from our template. 

<img width="150" alt="settings" src="img/db_dih2_ex.png">

> The code for it be found here as ['DB_DIH2_EX.db'](/api/DB_DIH2_EX.db). 

2. The following structure will be generated in.

3. To able to communicate with the PLC a protocol was put in place. The TRIG signal that is of type INT will be our exchange interface with predefined commands as follow: <br>
* 0   - Waiting Trigger; <br>
* 1   - Trigger to Write Workstation data; <br>
* 2   - Trigger to Write Unit data; <br>
* 3   - Trigger to Write Workstation status; <br>
* 100 - Write Production Error; <br>
* 101 - Write Part Error;<br>
* 255 - Bussy;<br>

4. After creating the logic and the DB in the PLC we can start our api. If the connection is not succesfull an error will be thrown in the logfile.

## Testing

For a connection test with the PLC we can check the lower right status life beat indicator.<br>
Debug and testing of the data exchange between PLC-API-FIWARE can be done in the created interface of the api or via the logfile if there are errors or something doens't seem to be working. <br>
This data exchange is done in realtime (~500ms) and the data is refreshed at every cycle.  <br>
For data test a PLC logic needs to be configured in order to be able to use the trigger and generate data to be sent.
