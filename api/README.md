## Background

Proposed solution allows access to additional production line performance data in an automated manner. Inno system uses this data for performance analysis (reports). The new services delivered within DIH2 include:

1. Real time product Tracking - visualisation of machines’ current status, i.e. uptime, number of cycles completed, time to complete, etc.
2. Early warnings for production station status (monitoring) – sending notifications to shop-floor workers when the robot’s task is near to completion so there is no idling time
3. Data Collection – Automatic data collection which will be used for a concise evaluation of the entire process
4. Performance Analysis – using collected data a real time performance analysis helps improving the OEE KPIs

In order to achive this the broker was required to facilitate the exchange of data between the PLC, cratedb and fiware.
